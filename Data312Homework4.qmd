## Homework 4

The primary goal of homework 4 is to give you hands-on practice with a number of dplyr verbs we went over in Lecture 3 and 4 via Exercise3 and Exercise4.

For your convenience, the relevant resources for this homework are as follows:

1.  Lecture 3 slides is located here: <https://jmtfeliciano.github.io/DATA312Spring2025/Data312Spring2025_Lecture3#1>

    <https://jmtfeliciano.github.io/DATA312Spring2025/Exercise3FilledIn.html>

4.  Filled in Exercise 4 HTML page as a reference guide:

    <https://jmtfeliciano.github.io/DATA312Spring2025/Data312Exercise4FilledIn.html>

## What you need to do

You will be assigned tasks throughout this Quarto Document where you will need to fill in R code appropriately based on what was taught in Exercise3.qmd and Exercise4.qmd

## Preliminaries

This R code chunk will load the tidyverse packages and create a data frame called **sba_investments**

Make sure to run this script before doing any of the tasks below which will allow you to create **sba_investments** using csv data from my GitHub account (also make sure to quickly look at the printed data to examine variables/columns and general contents):

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

sba_investments <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmtfeliciano/teachingdata/refs/heads/main/data7a2024localdata.csv")
head(sba_investments, 10) 
```

## **Background information on** sba_investments

**sba_investments** is a partial extract of data made publicly available in <https://data.sba.gov/dataset/7-a-504-foia> by the United States Small Business Administration (<https://www.sba.gov/>), a federal agency that provides support to entrepreneurs and small businesses.

**sba_investments** is data for the 7(a) loan assistance program made by the agency for Fiscal Year 2024. The subset you are working with is data I restricted for the purpose of this homework to the following states: DC, DE, MD, NC, VA, and WV. To learn more about 7(a), you may visit <https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/7a-loans> to learn more.

To access detailed documentation for each of the variable or column contained within the data, you may download and access the 7a Data Dictionary via <https://data.sba.gov/dataset/7-a-504-foia/resource/6898b986-a895-47b4-bb7e-c6b286b23a7b>

## Task 1 (1 pt)

Use the distinct() verb with the **sba_investments** we loaded earlier to show the the distinct values of **LoanStatus** in the R code chunk below:

```{r}
sba_investments |>
  distinct(LoanStatus)
```

## Task 2 (1 pt)

Suppose you are tasked by a supervisor to find the specific record in **sba_investments** where the borrower state (**BorrState**) is "DC" with a **NaicsCode** of 238150

Using filter() with **sba_investments**, show or print the required specific record below:

```{r}
sba_investments |>
  filter(BorrState == "DC") |>
  filter(NaicsCode == 238150)
```

## Task 3 (1 pt)

Use select() in the R code chunk below to create a data subset of **sba_investments** that only contains **Program**, **BorrName**, **BorrState**, **GrossApproval**, **InitialInterestRate**, **NaicsDescription**, and **JobsSupported**. Save this data into your R environment as **sba_subset**. At the end of the code chunk, print a sample of **sba_subset** by using head() or glimpse():

```{r}
sba_subset <- sba_investments |>
  select(Program, BorrName, BorrState, GrossApproval, InitialInterestRate, NaicsDescription, JobsSupported)

head(sba_subset)
```

## Task 4 (1 pt)

Using **sba_subset,** calculate the sum of jobs supported (**JobsSupported)** broken down by borrower state (**BorrState).** Name this sum column however you want (e.g., total_jobs).

**Hint you may not be offered in an exam:** using group_by() and summarize() with sum().

```{r}
sba_subset |>
  group_by(BorrState) |>
  summarize(total_jobs = sum(JobsSupported, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Task 5 (1 pt)

Using **sba_subset,** calculate and print the mean interest rate (**InitialInterestRate)** broken down by borrower state (**BorrState).** Name this mean column however you want (e.g., average_interest).

**Hint you may not be offered in an exam:** using group_by() and summarize() with mean().

```{r}
sba_subset |>
  group_by(BorrState) |>
  summarize(average_initerest = mean(InitialInterestRate, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Task 6 (1 pt)

Using **sba_subset** and summarize()**,** calculate and print the overall median loan approval amount (**GrossApproval**) *for the entire data set*. Name this median column however you want (e.g., median_approved).

**Hint you may not be offered in an exam:** summarize() with median() and without group_by() this time.

```{r}
sba_subset |>
  summarize(median_approved = median(GrossApproval, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Task 7 (1 pt)

Using **sba_subset,** calculate and print the overall sum of total loan amount (**GrossApproval**) approved for Nail Salons only (i.e., where **NaicsDescription** is "Nail Salons") within the data set. Name this median column however you want (e.g., sum_approved).

**Hint that you may not be offered in an exam:** sba_subset is piped into filter() which is piped into summarize().

```{r}
sba_subset |>
  filter(NaicsDescription == "Nail Salons") |>
  summarize(sum_approved = sum(GrossApproval, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Task 8 (1 pt)

Using **sba_subset,** calculate and print the overall sum of total loan amount (**GrossApproval**) approved for Nail Salons only (i.e., where **NaicsDescription** is "Nail Salons") in Virginia and Maryland only (i.e., where **BorrState** is VA or MD). Name this median column however you want (e.g., sum_approved).

**Hint that you may not be offered in an exam:** Modify your Task 7 code by further refining your filter() statement or by piping what you already wrote into another filter() to account for the additional request in Task 8.

```{r}
sba_subset |>
  filter(NaicsDescription == "Nail Salons") |>
  filter(BorrState %in% c("VA", "MD")) |>
  summarise(sum_approved = sum(GrossApproval, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Task 9 (1 pt)

The table you will need to complete (see prompt below):

| Top 5 Industry (NaicsDescription) with Most SBA 7(a) Loan Approved | Total \$ Loan Approved (GrossApproval) |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels                           | 200382300                              |
| Full-Service Restaurants                                           | 134761300                              |
| Full-Service Restaurants                                           | 89105000                               |
| Child Day Care Services                                            | 43934100                               |
| Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors                | 40185000                               |

Suppose you are a data analyst within SBA who is tasked to identify the top 5 industries that received the most approved loans. In other words, you need to calculate and identify the top 5 industries (NaicsDescription) with the highest loan approved (GrossApproval).

Using **sba_subset**, fill in the empty table above. You will not get credit unless you write an R code within the following R chunk that prints this insight below that you can copy from. Note: if the R chunk below partially obscures the output you need to copy from, please rerun the code via the R console for an unobstructed view of the output.

**Hint that you may not be offered in an exam:** pipe sba_subsetintousing group_by() then pipe into summarize() then pipe into arrange(desc(\[your sum column name\])). The first five rows are what you need.

```{r}
top_industries <- sba_subset |>
  group_by(NaicsDescription) |>
  summarise(total_loans_approved = sum(GrossApproval, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_loans_approved))

top_industries
```

## Task 10 (1 pt)

Using **sba_subset,** create a new R object into your R environment named **sba_subset_v2** after using rename() to rename the following: Program into program_name; BorrName into borrower_name; BorrState into borrower_state; GrossApproval into loan_approved; InitialInterestRate into interest_rate; NaicsDescription into industry_description; and JobsSupported into jobs_supported.

Make sure to print **sba_subset_named** below too using head() or glimpse():

```{r}
sba_subset_v2 <- sba_subset |>
  rename(borrower_name = BorrName, 
         borrower_state = BorrState, 
         loan_approved = GrossApproval,
         interest_rate = InitialInterestRate,
         industry_description = NaicsDescription,
         jobs_supported = JobsSupported)

head(sba_subset_v2)
```
